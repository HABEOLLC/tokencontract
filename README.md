# HABEO

## What is HABEO?
HABEO is an ambitious project that aims to standardize the dialy use of crypto tokens.
To accomplish our goal, we started by creating a token that favors those that use it daily while making it more difficult to become a whale and use pump & dump as a method to force value out of the system.
In order to keep the token true to its spirit, we have renounced ownership, locked the LP forever while also leaving 100% of the tokens to be acquired after deployment. This means, there are zero dev tokens.
To make things as transparent as they get, we have made all the code for the token and the tools available to the community and we have commented it with great deal of detail so everyone can understand what the code is doing.

Since knowledge is key to success, we have invested a great amount of time and resources on documenting and explaining all code and processes in multiple languages so the world can feel safe with using HABEO (and crypto in general).

Because we know that acquiring tokens today is a multi step process that looks extremely complicated to new users, we understand that we need to work hard in bringing those barriers down. 
As the community grows, we will work with our community on making it easier for everyone to send and receive tokens between parties as well as swapping tokens.

As we are expecting the community to grow strong, we anticipate that there will be enough interest ito build all projects that the community decides to pursue. an easy to use wallet, an easy to use exchange and ultimately, our own blockchain crypto to support them.
We believe that the stage is set for projects like this to succeed.

## How is HABEO different from the rest of the hundreds of tokens out there?
HABEO is a community token. We don't own any part of the project.
We can (and will) acquire tokens at the early distribution and will use them as much as we can in daily operations once the token takes off.
We don't have any advantage over any other person that acquires tokens.
Because the early distribution aims to minimize whales, none of us has any more chances to become one than any other person that chooses to participate in the project.
We've created HABEO but we've made the token, the website and the communities open to the public.
Everyone can contribute and help build the community that will make crypto an everyday tool.

## How can I contribute to the project?
As every token, HABEO becomes immutable after we deploy it. So, this code cannot be modified in THIS version of the protocol.
However, as we want to collect feedback, please comment (on any of our platforms) or open issues here in GitHub so we can make things better for the wallet, the exchange and the blockchain.
You can also contribute with the website: https://github.com/HABEOLLC/habeotoken.com
We want our website to help everyone around the globe to understand crypto in general and HABEO in particular so they can use it with all confidence on their day to day operations.
In order to accomplish this, we want our website, documents and videos (comin soon) translated in as many languages as possible. If you don't see your language represented or if you see any errors in the translations, please open an issue in GitHub or (if you know how to do it) send us a pull request with the changes and we'll merge them appropriately.
